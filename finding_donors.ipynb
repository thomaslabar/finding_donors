In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "1. Logistic regression can be used to [identify fraudulent financial transactions](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/machine-learning/what-is-logistic-regression/)\n",
    "2. The strengths of logistic regression is that it is simple, efficient, does not have hyperparameters, and its resulting weights are relatively interpretable (although the transformations here may make that difficult). It performs well on linear data with little correlation between features and on data that requires relatively few features for prediction.\n",
    "3. It's simplicity can hurt its explanatory power. It does not work well with correlated featured or non-linear data. \n",
    "4. I'm using logistic regression as a first-pass simple model for this problem with the hope that relatively-few features will be required to classify income. I actually do expect the other two models to perform better in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 2: AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AdaBoost can be used to [predict customer churn](https://hackernoon.com/under-the-hood-of-adaboost-8eb499d78eab). However, AdaBoost can be used for any application any of its weak learners can be used for. \n",
    "2. AdaBoost is a powerful algorithm with the flexibility of using many other models as its weak learners. It can improve the performance of most other non-ensemble supervised classifiers and has fewer hyperparameters than other models. It should be used with datasets with \"nice\" data without outliers and much noise.\n",
    "3. AdaBoost is sensitive to outliers and noisy data and should not be used in datasets with these features.\n",
    "4. I'm using AdaBoost due to its power and ability to improve the performance of many other supervised learning models. It has been described as the [best \"out of the box\" classifier](https://blog.paperspace.com/adaboost-optimizer/). It may not work due to the presence of outliers in some of my features, which in that case I expect random forests to perform better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model 3: Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random forests can be used to [evaluate customers with high credit risk](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/random-forest). \n",
    "2. Random forests work well for large datasets with correlated features, unbalanced features, and outliers in the data. It is strong at preventing overfitting.\n",
    "3. One of the biggest downsides to random forests are that they feel like black-boxes. They should be avoided if one wants to be able to interpret the outcome of the model and which features are most important.\n",
    "4. I'm using a random forest because it seems like a powerful model that avoids many of the weaknesses of other models. Interpretation is not part of the issue here. This problem doesn't involve critical information such as medical information where one would want an understanding of why a model is giving certain predictions, so I think a random forest should be an ideal fit.\n",

    "In the above exercise, I trained three supervised learning models, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, and RandomForest, to predict which individuals make more than \\$50,000. All three models performed better on both accuracy and the fbeta score (which prioritizes precision of our predictions) than our naive model of assuming every individual makes more than 50,000 dollars. In terms of training time, logistic regression both trained and tested the faster, likely due to its simplicity. The random forest model required the longest training and testing time. However, these times were always on the order of a few seconds, so I do not believe this factor should matter in picking a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a Random Forest clearly performed the best on our training data, all three models performed similarly on the testing data. However, AdaBoost did perform better in testing on both metrics when all training data was considered. Given these results, I will move forward on optimizing my AdaBoost model. The fact that it performed similarily on training and testing data suggests it can be improved. Meanwhile, the Random Forest model seemed prone to overfitting, given its much better performance on the training data than the testing data."

    "The model I have chosen for this problem is AdaBoost, an ensemble algorithm that improves the perfomance of a 'weak learner' algorithm, often a decision tree. In AdaBoost, one starts by training a weak learner on the data and calculates its accuracy. Then, using a modified dataset which overweights the data that the previous weak learner failed to classify, one trains another weak learner. One repeats this process many times, each time overweighting the data that the previous learner failed to classify. Next, one assigns a weight to each of these weak learners based on the ratio of accurate to inaccurate predictions. Finally, to make a prediction, the models \"vote,\" with each's model vote weighted by the weight previously calculated. "

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

    "My optimization procedure on my AdaBoost model did improve its performance. Unfortunately, the gain in performance was slight and much lower than expected. If I was to perform this procedure again, I would consider trying to optimize the random forest model tested above, which have a greater performance potential on the training set. However, the optimized model did greatly outperform the naive predictor originally created, so the fine-tuning of this model was not a waste and will improve the capabilities of CharityML to identify potential donors.

Age was fourth, as older workers generally make more than younger workers. Finally, race was fifth, due to socioeconomic disparities present in the United States (I could also see gender being placed here).

    "I predicted two out of the five most important features, although the order is diifferent. One could also argue I predicted education right, but missed which encoding of education mattered. Based on my reasoning above, I should have predicted capital losses would matter, for the same reason that capital gains mattered. I am surprised that \"hours worked per week\" played a large role. I expected that variable to not vary that much across the individuals. I also find it interesting that these five features combined only explain a little over fifty percent of the data. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
